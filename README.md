# Sorting Methods

The sorting methods problem is the second project of the *Algorithms and Data Structures* class, the code is written in C language.

## Introduction

In this project, we want to measure all diferent kinds of sorting methods: bubble sort, heap sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, rank sort, selection sort, shaker sort and shell sort.

Goals of this project:

- Draw graphs of the average execution time for each sorting algorithm
- For each algorithm, comment the best and worst execution times 
- Which algorithm should we choose? (considering the execution time and the effort to write and verify the actual code)

## How to compile and run

This can be done by running the following commands

```
make sorting_methods
./sorting_methods -measure | tee output.txt
```

The program will take some time to finish (somewhere between 1 hour and 4 hours)
